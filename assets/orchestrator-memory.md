# Orchestrator — Memory Detail (lazy-loaded)

Bind this to the parent Pi session only, on organic progress/recovery or SDD phase memory reads/writes. Not always-on; loaded on demand from `assets/orchestrator.md`'s `## Memory Contract` pointer.

### Organic feature continuity

For substantial authorized organic implementation, the parent maintains `odd/tasks/<feature-name>.md` and an Engram recovery copy under topic `odd/<feature-name>/tasks`, scoped to the current project. Use a descriptive filename-safe feature name, reuse the same identity, and never overwrite another feature. Keep one feature document, not a separate plan file or topic: objective, problem, why, scope, constraints, actionable checklist with stable task IDs, acceptance criteria and checks, progress, verification evidence, and next step. Include concise rationale for meaningful accepted changes. Routine corrections stay with their tasks; no exhaustive decision journal. Mirror the full current document and repository-relative file locator, not only a summary or completion notice.

Accepted user, review, or verification changes automatically update affected intent and TODOs: preserve valid completed and unrelated work; add genuinely new tasks or reopen invalidated items with a reason, and revise their checks. Findings alone never authorize scope expansion or automatic acceptance. New business scope still requires user authorization. Check off only observed outcomes with applicable proof; record failed, unavailable, skipped, or pending checks honestly. The parent merges bounded worker results rather than replacing the entire feature with one worker's partial view.

Persist local progress first, then mirror through the existing injected Engram save tool. Read back both writes; they are not atomic. If Engram is unavailable, preserve local progress and explicitly mark the mirror pending; do not claim persistence succeeded or block unrelated safe work. Resynchronize when available. If a file write is unsafe or unavailable, preserve existing state and report the limitation. Preserve both versions on irreconcilable edits and ask only about the real conflict; never silently prefer a newer timestamp.

On resume, use `mem_context`, then project/feature-scoped `mem_search`, and `mem_get_observation` for the full saved document; read the actual task file. Do not infer active work from the newest global memory. Reconcile current requirements, code, and proof before continuing the next unfinished task. Preserve pending mirrors and conflicting edits; a missing copy is not permission to overwrite surviving progress. Use the injected equivalents of these existing memory tools, never invent availability.

Before implementation or resume, the parent reads both the actual file and full observation, reconciles them, and passes the locator and relevant context; workers read the document before edits. Small work without a document still receives its authorized scope and checks.

The existing `todo` tool is an optional session/UI projection, not a third authority. Rebuild it from reconciled feature progress when useful; its replay or completed-list clearing must not delete or replace the durable file or Engram copy. Small/read-only work does not acquire an ODD artifact merely because the UI displays tasks.

### SDD phases

Each SDD phase subagent reads its own required inputs directly from the active backend; the parent passes artifact references (topic keys or file paths), NOT the content itself. Phase subagents persist their artifact before returning.

| Phase          | Reads                                                   | Writes           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `sdd-explore`  | nothing                                                 | `explore`        |
| `sdd-research` | exploration                                             | `research` + `preproposal` |
| `sdd-proposal` | exploration (optional)                                  | `proposal`       |
| `sdd-spec`     | proposal (required)                                     | `spec`           |
| `sdd-design`   | proposal (required)                                     | `design`         |
| `sdd-tasks`    | spec + design (required)                                | `tasks`          |
| `sdd-apply`    | tasks + spec + design + `apply-progress` (if it exists) | `apply-progress` |
| `sdd-verify`   | spec + tasks + `apply-progress`                         | `verify-report`  |
| `sdd-sync`     | proposal + spec + design + tasks + `verify-report`      | `sync-report`    |
| `sdd-archive`  | all artifacts                                           | `archive-report` |
| `sdd-status`   | change artifacts (read-only)                            | nothing          |

- SDD artifact keys: in memory/hybrid mode, phase artifacts use stable topic keys such as `sdd/<change>/proposal`, `sdd/<change>/spec`, `sdd/<change>/design`, `sdd/<change>/tasks`, `sdd/<change>/apply-progress`, `sdd/<change>/verify-report`, `sdd/<change>/sync-report`, and `sdd/<change>/archive-report`.
- When the optional research lane is selected, `sdd-research` uses the additional topic keys `sdd/<change>/research` and `sdd/<change>/preproposal` (openspec: `openspec/changes/<change>/research.md`).
- If memory tools are unavailable, do not pretend persistence exists; return artifacts inline and/or write OpenSpec files.

Memory lifecycle rule (when Engram exposes lifecycle metadata/tooling):

- At session start or before architecture-sensitive work, call the injected Engram review tool with action `list` for the current project when the tool is available.
- If the injected Engram review tool is unavailable, do not fail the task. Continue with the injected Engram context/search tools, and still apply lifecycle metadata from any returned observations when present.
- `active` memories may be used normally.
- `needs_review` memories are stale context, not trusted facts.
- When a retrieved memory is marked `needs_review`, surface that stale context to the user and verify it against current evidence before relying on it.
- Do NOT call the injected Engram review tool with action `mark_reviewed` automatically. Only call `mark_reviewed` after explicit user confirmation or through a dedicated memory maintenance command.
