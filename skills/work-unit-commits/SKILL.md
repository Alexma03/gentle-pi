## When to Use

Load this skill when deciding what belongs in each commit or PR.

Use it for:

- Splitting a feature into reviewable work.
- Preparing commits before opening a PR.
- Turning a large change into chained or stacked PRs.
- Keeping reviewer cognitive load healthy.
- Applying SDD tasks without producing a conceptually overloaded or incoherent PR.

## Critical Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Commit by work unit | A commit represents a deliverable behavior, fix, migration, or docs unit. |
| Do not commit by file type | Avoid `models`, then `services`, then `tests` if none works alone. |
| Keep tests with code | Tests belong in the same commit as the behavior they verify. |
| Keep docs with the user-visible change | Docs belong with the feature or workflow they explain. |
| Tell a story | A reviewer should understand why each commit exists from its diff and message. |
| Future PR-ready | Each commit should be a candidate chained PR when the change grows. |
| SDD workload guard | If SDD forecasts natural architectural or review boundaries, group commits into coherent PR slices before implementation. |

## Work Unit Checklist

Before committing, confirm:

- [ ] The commit has one clear purpose.
- [ ] The repo still makes sense after applying only this commit.
- [ ] Tests or docs for this unit are included when relevant.
- [ ] Rollback is reasonable without reverting unrelated work.
- [ ] The commit message explains the outcome, not the file list.

## Split Examples

| Weak split | Better work-unit split |
|------------|------------------------|
| `add models` | `feat(auth): add token validation domain model and tests` |
| `add services` | `feat(auth): wire token validation into login flow` |
| `add tests` | Tests included with each behavior commit |
| `update docs` | Docs included with the user-facing change they explain |

## PR Relationship

Use work-unit commits as the foundation for chained PRs:

1. Build the smallest independent work unit.
2. Include verification for that unit.
3. Commit it with a Conventional Commit message.
4. If the work crosses natural domain, interface, risk, or verification boundaries, promote coherent commit groups into chained PRs.

## SDD Relationship

When `sdd-tasks` produces a qualitative Review Workload Forecast:

- Cohesive, focused work: keep work-unit commits inside one PR.
- Natural boundaries exist: commit by work unit and follow the selected delivery strategy.
- High cognitive or cross-domain burden: ask on `ask-on-risk`, auto-slice on `auto-chain`, or preserve one PR on `single-pr` only when the plan explains its cohesion.
- Never estimate or count lines, and never split a correct cohesive solution to satisfy a numeric threshold.

Each SDD work unit should map cleanly to a commit or PR with:

- clear start state,
- clear finished state,
- verification in the same unit,
- rollback that does not remove unrelated work.

## Commands

```bash
# Review the story before committing
git diff --name-status
git diff --cached --name-status

# Check recent commit style
git log --oneline -5
```
